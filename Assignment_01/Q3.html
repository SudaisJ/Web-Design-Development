     <h1>Pseudo-Elements</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        This is a simple paragraph to demonstrate the use of pseudo-elements in CSS.
        The first line and the first letter of this paragraph will be styled differently
        to show how pseudo-elements work.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another paragraph is added here to make the example clearer and more visible.
        Pseudo-elements allow styling specific parts of content without changing HTML.
